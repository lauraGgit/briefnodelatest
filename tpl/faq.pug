            h2 What is Brief?
            p Brief is a daily email that aggregates all of the Facebook notificiations you recieved in the past day and sends them to your inbox.
              button.btn.btn-primary(data-toggle="modal", data-target="#exampleModal") Check out an example email
            h2 Why is my email weird sometimes?
            p Brief is currently in
              b Beta
              |  so sometimes things might can a little funky as we work them out.
            h2 Why do you need me to Connect to Facebook?
            p In order to access your Facebook notifications, Brief needs to get permission from you to access certain data on Facebook. You can revoke this access any time under the Apps settings within Facebook.
            h2 What are you data are you storing?
            p Brief is actually storing very little about you. We only hold onto your email address, your Facebook ID number, and a unique string called an access token generated by Facebook to let Brief access your notifications. This token is only used to idenitfy information about you that comes from the Brief App. It cannot be used by other applications. You can learn more about them
              a(href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/access-tokens/") here
              | .
            h2 In the email digest, why do I sometimes not get the full post?
            p Unfortunately, what Facebook sends Brief is pretty limited and inconsistent. In order to get you readable notifications we pretty much have to send you what we recieve from Facebook. We are looking into ways to improve this!
            h2 How can I unsubscribe?
            p Log back onto Brief's homepage and when your settings load.
            h2 Anything else I should know?
            p Brief will automatically mark your messages as read after it sends.
